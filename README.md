## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Checking out this code?
Ensure the following installations:

npm install next@latest
npm install react@latest
npm install react-dom@latest

First, run the development server:

## Running
Run the development server:
npm run dev
Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
 
## Testing

Check out the test files inside the 'test_branch' branch 
To install the necessary test scripts, execute the following:

npm install -D vitest @vitejs/plugin-react jsdom @testing-library/react @testing-library/dom

##Installing @vitest/coverage-v8

When you run npm run test you will be prompted to install @vitest which you should accept.
Now run it again, this time with npm run test -- --coverage to generate a coverage report:
